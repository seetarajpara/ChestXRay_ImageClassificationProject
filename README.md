# Classification of Chest X-Rays (Pneumonia vs. Healthy)
## Pneumonia Background
- Pneumonia causes alveoli (air sacs in the lungs) to fill with fluid or pus
- Cause: bacterial, viral, or fungal infection
- Symptoms: cough with or without mucus, fever, chills, and trouble breathing
    - severity depends on age and overall health of the individual 
- Diagnosis: physical exam and chest X-ray imaging
    - Radiologists look for infiltrates (white spots) in the lungs for signs of infection
    - Lung inflammation is visualized by having denser, more opaque areas in imaging
